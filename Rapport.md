## Cover page
Cover page with project name, student names and photos

## Contributions
In the very beginning of the report, mention the contribution of each group member to the project work, both in terms of project writing but also code writing (Group reports are individualized). Consider generative AI(for example chatGPT) as a group member and credit it for its contribution to the group work.

## Requirement specifications
(what?)

## Analysis
(refinement of requirements)

## Design
(how? - paper solution – flow diagrams/pseudocode – before writing the code)

## Implementation
(how? - actual solution – after writing the code)

## Tests
(Does it work? - prove that the requirements are fulfilled)

## AI usage
Discussion about the use of generative AI in your project. What is it good for, what it’s not good for, how did it help you in the project work and with learning.

## Conclusion
(Summary of the highlights from the report)

## Appendix
(what doesn’t fit in the report – extra diagrams, test reports etc.)
